QMC project:

This project is based on my exam project in Computational Methods for Many Body Physics, a course that I attended while at TU Munich in the spring and sommer of 2018. The idea was to modify existing quantum monte carlo code to work for varying bond strengths. 

More information can be found in the power point

A better notebook will eventually be uploaded.
